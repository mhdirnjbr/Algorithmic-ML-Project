# Algorithmic Machine Learning Project

Having developed a keen eye for the emerging technologies around me, I have always been curious to discover how we are
able to help different industries such as financial services, health care, manufacturing and so on, using AI application.
The main reasons I decided to work on this algorithmic project were at first, to challenge myself to learn different
algorithms and develop my mathematical skills and at second, to obtain an adequate vision of AI world.

During this project, I mainly focused on following models :
- Linear Regression (With regularization)
- Logistic Regression (Linear & polynomial with regularization)
- One Vs All
- Neural Network

It is recommended to read the report in order to have more information about this project.
